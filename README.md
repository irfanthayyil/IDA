Loan Defauters Prediction

Imputed the missing data using MissForest, a Random Forest based iterative imputation technique
Trained a Hard voting Ensemble of Extra Trees, Catboost and Xgboost classifiers, each with hyper parameters tuned, on data over-sampled using SMOTE to secure a weighted F1 score 0.984 .
Leveraged the abundance of data to train a CTGAN to synthesize new training data points to solve the heavy class imbalance in the dataset. Trained a Neural Network that secured a final F1 scor
